# Fiat Frenzy 777 edition

Think money doesn't grow on trees? Think again.
Fiat Frenzy brings fractional reserve lending baked into the system, for everyone

Individual can loan their tokens to others, what makes this so special?
Well instead of forking your cash over like a common simpleton, you create the money from nothing and lend, like a commerical bank does for the loans they make.

What stops everyone from printing money ad infinitium? the reserve ratio.

no one may lend outside of the reserve ratio of ~61.8%
